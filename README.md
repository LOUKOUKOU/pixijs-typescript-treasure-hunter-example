# PIXIJS Treasure hunter example done in TypeScript

All I basically did was use this [boilerplate](https://github.com/jkanchelov/pixi-typescript-boilerplate]) and convert the [Treasure hunter example](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningPixi/blob/master/examples/17_treasureHunter.html) into a TypeScript friendly version.
